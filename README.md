#Troubleshooting
-----------------

If your custom CSS or JS code is not being applied to your website, make sure that you have saved your changes on the plugin settings page, and that the plugin is activated.

If you are experiencing other issues with the plugin, you can try disabling other plugins or switching to a different WordPress theme to see if this resolves the issue.

If you are still experiencing issues, you can contact the plugin developer for support or consult the plugin documentation for troubleshooting guidance.
